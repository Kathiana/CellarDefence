# Cellar Defence
 Short & simple 2D game created for fun of making small projects.
 
 Whole project stays public so you all can see my progress and solutions to problems I'm going to meet on my journey. 
 As soon as project will come to an end, the game will be published for free and the link will be included in Readme.
 
 If you would like to work on this project on your own, feel free to fork the repo.
